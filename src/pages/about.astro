      I’m Justin, a product-minded developer who loves shipping delightful
      experiences. I’ve been exploring the ChatGPT Apps SDK to help companies
      bring their existing products, data, and workflows into ChatGPT so users
      can access features and take action without leaving the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I focus on web and React Native, building polished, maintainable apps that
      make integrations feel natural and helpful.

      If you’d like to explore bringing your web or mobile experience into
      ChatGPT or just want to chat about possibilities, email me at
